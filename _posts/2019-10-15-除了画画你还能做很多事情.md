### 引言
                                
                                
**Why people believe they cann't draw ,and how to prove they can ?--Graham Shaw**

I have got a question for you ,do you think that you can draw or not ?It is a little bit like ,cann't people think of spelling or singing .We think well you can either do it or you cann't .But I think you can ,Because when people say they cann't draw ,I think it is more to do with beliefs rather than talent and ability.
